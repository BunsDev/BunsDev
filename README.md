Devico daily. Open to collaborations once I have down time in January 2021 and onward. Recently decided to start blogging and you may track how that is going by visiting [Learn-Solidity.com](Learn-Solidity.com).

Looking to get involved? We are interested in recruiting **Smart Contract Developers** for Governor DAO, so please shoot me a message using any of my contact links above and let me know your strengths, experience, and a bit about yourself as well.

## Proof of Work
### GOVDAO Bakery
- [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/CryptoUnico/bakery) | [Rinkeby Front-End](https://easybake.finance/)
- Testing grounds for GovTreasurer, the Official Treasurer of [GovernorDAO](http://GovernorDAO.org).
- Creative concept of a bakery.
- Charges a baker's fee of 2% upon deposit.
- Stake to bake governance tokens.

### Merkle Airdrop
- [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/CryptoUnico/merkle-distributor) | [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/address/0x7ea0f8bb2f01c197985c285e193dd5b8a69836c0#code) | [Front-End](https://airdrop.GovernorDAO.org)
- Official [GovernorDAO](https://twitter.com/Governor_DAO) Merkle Airdrop Distribution for CBDAO Rug Pull survivors.
- Gamefied elements to incentivize participants to claim at a later date.
- Rules: on day one, 10% of the claim is available and increases 1% daily until 100% is reached.
- Deflationary: 50% of forfeited tokens are burned forever, thus decreasing total max supply.

### Liquidity Mine
- [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/CryptoUnico/govtreasurer) | [Etherscan](http://etherscan.io/address/0x4DaC3e07316D2A31baABb252D89663deE8F76f09#code)
- Official [GovernorDAO](https://GovernorDAO.org) liquidity mine.
- Slip drip, fair distribution of 1.2M GDAO governance tokens
- Accounts for roughly one-third of the GDAO total supply.

### Swapico
- [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/CryptoUnico/Swapico) | [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/address/0xcc23ef76b46ed576caa5a1481f4400d2543f8006#code)
- Swap an one pre-determined token for another at a 1:1 ratio, though modifiable.
- Used for GDAO sLP to LP conversion.
