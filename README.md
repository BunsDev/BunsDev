## About Uni (she)
Devico daily. Open to collaborations once I have down time in January 2021 and onward. Recently decided to start blogging and you may track how that is going by visiting [Learn-Solidity.com](Learn-Solidity.com).

Looking to get involved? We are interested in recruiting **Smart Contract Developers** for Governor DAO, so please shoot me a message using any of my contact links above and let me know your strengths, experience, and a bit about yourself as well.

## Proof of Work
### Production
- [GOVDAO Bakery](https://easybake.finance): creative concept of a bakery that charges a baker's fee to those who stake to bake governance tokens.

### Testing Phase
- [Liquidity Mine](https://github.com/CryptoUnico/govtreasurer): the official [Governor DAO](https://twitter.com/Governor_DAO) liquidity mine, which will supply 1.2M governance tokens at a slow drip, accounting for roughly one-third of the GDAO total supply.

- [Merkle Airdrop](https://github.com/CryptoUnico/merkle-distributor): the Official GovernorDAO Merkle Airdrop Distribution for those who survived the CBDAO Rug Pull event, read more about the rug pull of CBDAO just a few weeks after reaching a 50M Market Capitalization on [CryptoSlate](https://cryptoslate.com/trust-no-one-founders-of-once-50-million-ethereum-coin-rug-pull-users/). This is a fork of the UNI Merkle Distributor with a number of gamefied elements to incentivize participants to claim at a later date. For those who claim on day one, only 10% of the claim is available, increasing 1% daily until 100% is acheived. Also introduces a deflationary mechanism.
