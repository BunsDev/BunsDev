# About Her
Devico daily. Open to collaborations once I have down time in January 2021 and onward. Recently decided to start blogging and you may track how that is going by visiting [Learn-Solidity.com](Learn-Solidity.com).

Looking to get involved? We are interested in recruiting **Smart Contract Developers** for Governor DAO, so please shoot me a message using any of my contact links above and let me know your strengths, experience, and a bit about yourself as well.
